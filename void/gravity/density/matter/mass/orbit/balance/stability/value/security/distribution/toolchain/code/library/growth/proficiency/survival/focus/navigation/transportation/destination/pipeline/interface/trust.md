an [ecosystem](../ecosystem.md) depends on careful balance between many;

[exchange](../../exchange.md) is a natural process.

<br>

physicality provides a sense of [division](/void/gravity/density/matter/mass/division.md);

like the sky and the [ground](/void/gravity/density/matter/mass/orbit/balance/ground.md).

<br>

[water]() is the universal solution;

fluidity generates balance across boundaries,

by gradually making rough and sharp edges smooth

[air]() is a truly precious thing. breathe deep [wisdom]().

<br>

take [care](), and be aware of darkness;

[light]() is source [energy]()

[love]() is simple.

[peace]()
